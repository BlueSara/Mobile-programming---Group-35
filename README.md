Welcome to StudyGroup
Our app is a collaborative platform where students can ask for help, share knowledge, and work together on academic tasks.
It’s designed to make studying more interactive where students can post about assignments or specific problems they’re stuck on, follow posts with similar challenges, or offer to help others.

Once students connect over a shared problem, they can start a StudyGroup to brainstorm, share insights, and find solutions.
